**demo_blanks.ipynb**: Same as demo_filled.ipynb, but with blanks suitable for an in-class live coding session. Use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to open.

**demo_filled.ipynb**: Worked example of a functional character-level RNN for classifying the language of names. Use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to open.

**demo_filled.py**: Same as demo_filled.ipynb, but in Python format. Use a code editor or IDE to open.

**demo_finished.py**: Same as demo_filled.py, but with optimizer and TensorBoard integration. Use a code editor or IDE to open.
